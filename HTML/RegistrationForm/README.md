# Registration Form

#### Recreate all the html elements shown on the image! As you haven't learned yet how to use css to make the form look nice, don't worry about how your registration form looks for now.

##### Your HTML should contain the following tags:

 - `<input>` with these values in the "type" attribute:
 - text
 - password
 - date
 - radio
 - submit
 - `<textarea>`
 - `<select>`

You'll get to use forms in one way or another in almost every assignment for the rest of the bootcamp so don't feel the need to memorize all of the different form tags and attributes today. You can always come back to this chapter for reference! In the next assignment, we'll create a fake blog using forms as well as all of the other HTML tags we learned today!
